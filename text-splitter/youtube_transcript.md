0 -> electric cars have many advantages which\n2 -> have helped lead to their Rising\n3 -> popularity such as requiring a lot less\n6 -> maintenance however the battery is still\n8 -> very expensive and if it ever needs to\n10 -> be replaced it&#39;s a huge expense luckily\n13 -> there are practices you can put into\n15 -> place to make the battery last a really\n18 -> really long time and there are things\n20 -> you really shouldn&#39;t do which can\n22 -> dramatically shorten that lifetime my\n24 -> goal for this video is to not only\n25 -> explain the best and worst practices but\n28 -> actually explain why at the microscopic\n31 -> level why these are good or bad ideas\n33 -> now before we get into these practices\n36 -> it&#39;s worth mentioning this video is\n37 -> about nmc batteries meaning batteries\n39 -> made up of nickel manganese and Cobalt\n42 -> oxides it&#39;s a chemistry that gives you a\n44 -> lot of range and it&#39;s commonly used in46 -> the automotive space now if you don&#39;t\n48 -> know what chemistry your electric car&#39;s\n50 -> battery uses and why would you well much\n53 -> of these are good practices regardless\n55 -> we&#39;ll get into exceptions later so we&#39;re\n58 -> going to have three main rules number\n60 -> one don&#39;t store your car&#39;s battery at\n63 -> 100% for long periods of time especially\n66 -> when it&#39;s hot out now leaving your\n68 -> electric car in the hot sun for months\n70 -> at a time sounds like an edge case and\n72 -> it is but it helps lay the foundation\n74 -> for this video now if you haven&#39;t yet\n76 -> seen my video on how a lithium ion\n78 -> battery works that is certainly worth\n80 -> checking out but the big question here\n82 -> is why do batteries lose capacity over\n85 -> time and I&#39;ve Illustrated many of the\n87 -> reasons here there&#39;s a lot of reasons\n89 -> why batteries will lose capacity over91 -> time the important thing to keep in mind\n93 -> is that if the battery is hotter and if\n95 -> the battery is at a higher voltage which\n97 -> occurs when it&#39;s at a higher state of\n99 -> charge these reactions are more\n101 -> prominent and they happen more quickly\n103 -> so you get more degradation when you\n105 -> have higher temperatures and at a higher\n107 -> voltage in other words a higher state of\n109 -> charge so one example I want to look at\n111 -> is called the solid electrolyte\n113 -> interface formation which occurs on both\n116 -> the particles in the anode as well as\n118 -> the particles in the cathode where it is\n120 -> then called cathode electrolyte\n122 -> interface so very simply what happens\n124 -> when you&#39;re originally creating the\n126 -> battery and you add the liquid\n127 -> electrolyte and you put it through its\n129 -> very first charge cycle well this solid\n132 -> electrolyte interface forms on these134 -> particles and this formation consumes\n137 -> the electrolyte it consumes lithium it\n139 -> consumes materials from the cathode and\n141 -> anode and so you&#39;re consuming useful\n143 -> materials from that battery and as a\n145 -> result you actually lose about 10% of\n147 -> the battery&#39;s initial capacity on that\n149 -> very first charge now you as a consumer\n152 -> never see this because this is done at\n153 -> the factory long before you ever get a\n155 -> product using this battery but it is\n157 -> worth mentioning because this continues\n159 -> to grow and so as long as this\n162 -> electrolyte interface continues to grow\n164 -> and consume other materials it means\n165 -> it&#39;s taking away from the usefulness of\n168 -> your battery now there was a really cool\n170 -> study done where they found that if you\n172 -> store a battery at a higher temperature\n174 -> it has more degradation but they also176 -> found that if you store a battery at a\n178 -> higher state of charge it also has more\n180 -> degradation so what did they do well\n182 -> they took a bunch of batteries and they\n184 -> stored them in a room at 50° C so very\n188 -> warm and they stored these batteries\n190 -> with a different state of charge so one\n192 -> of them at 100% state of charge one at\n194 -> 90% one at 80% and so on and what did\n197 -> they find well the battery that was\n199 -> stored at 100% state of charge had less\n202 -> than 60% of its original capacity after\n206 -> less than 200 days so it had degraded a\n210 -> ton versus the battery stored at 30%\n212 -> state of charge was only down to 85% of\n216 -> its original rated capacity after about\n219 -> 400 days so significantly more capacity\n223 -> and much longer duration than it was in\n225 -> the test so heat and voltage are both\n228 -> bad for battery degradation now there&#39;s230 -> an Incredible video by Professor Jeff\n232 -> Dawn a lithium ion battery researcher\n235 -> with seemingly endless knowledge in this\n237 -> space who also had a 5-year research\n239 -> partner partnership with Tesla for\n240 -> battery development he provides specific\n243 -> advice so for each of these three rules\n246 -> I&#39;m going to share his advice for what\n248 -> you should do all right so say you&#39;re\n250 -> storing your electric car for a long\n252 -> period of time and it&#39;s going to be in a\n254 -> hot environment what should you do well\n256 -> he says you should Target a 30% state of\n258 -> charge for that duration now if you&#39;re\n261 -> storing it in the cold even for a long\n263 -> period of time there&#39;s no worries\n265 -> because of the cold temperatures you&#39;ll\n267 -> have very little reactivity so storing\n269 -> it at say 70% is no big deal number two\n272 -> don&#39;t wait until the battery is low to275 -> recharge it unless necessary now the\n277 -> critical part here is that you have a\n279 -> relatively low depth of discharge\n281 -> meaning say keeping your battery at 80%\n284 -> and only discharging to 60% before\n286 -> charging again it&#39;s fine to use the\n289 -> whole battery when you need it but after\n290 -> a short trip plug it in a bunch of small\n293 -> charges is much better than in frequent\n296 -> F depth charges okay so why well let&#39;s\n300 -> look at the particles that make up the\n301 -> cathode and if we zoom in on one of\n304 -> these electrode particles we can see\n306 -> that it&#39;s made up of many many many\n309 -> small crystallites and each one of these\n311 -> small crystallites has its own structure\n313 -> that&#39;s repeated so you&#39;ve got oxygen\n315 -> metals and lithium that&#39;s moving to and\n317 -> from the anode back to the cathode back\n319 -> to the anode and so as this lithium322 -> leaves this crystal structure well this\n324 -> formation expands in One Direction and\n327 -> it shrinks in another formation and\n330 -> again the orientation of these are all\n332 -> over the place so you&#39;ve got a bunch of\n334 -> different crystals all with different\n335 -> orientation that are expanding and\n337 -> Contracting in different ways so you can\n340 -> imagine that as that keeps happening you\n342 -> start to have cracks form within this\n344 -> particle as these particles are getting\n346 -> bigger and smaller they&#39;re creating\n347 -> these cracks within the particle well as\n350 -> these cracks form you have that cathode\n353 -> electrolyte interface formation so again\n355 -> you start consuming more materials more\n358 -> useful materials within the battery from\n360 -> the electrolyte the lithium things like\n363 -> that and so you have battery degradation\n365 -> okay so why does depth of discharge367 -> matter then well the growth of these\n370 -> crystals is roughly proportional to the\n373 -> depth of discharge so for example if\n375 -> you&#39;re just going from 60% battery to\n377 -> 40% battery well that&#39;s only 20% of your\n380 -> total battery right versus if you&#39;re\n382 -> going from 100% to 0% 100% of your total\n385 -> battery so that 60 to 40 has about a\n387 -> fifth of the effect of this growth and\n390 -> contraction that you have Within These\n392 -> crystals meaning if you use these\n394 -> smaller battery ranges you have much\n397 -> less cracking occur within these\n398 -> particles and the battery lasts\n400 -> significantly longer so again a really\n403 -> cool study looked at how a battery&#39;s\n405 -> depth of discharge impacted its\n407 -> normalized capacity over time okay so\n409 -> for this study they&#39;re putting the same\n411 -> amount of energy in and out of all the\n414 -> batteries but they&#39;re using a different416 -> percentage of the battery to do it so\n418 -> for example if you&#39;re just going from\n420 -> 40% to 60% well you&#39;re going to have a\n422 -> bunch of small charges versus if you&#39;re\n424 -> going from 0 to 100% you&#39;re going to\n426 -> have fewer charges but the same amount\n428 -> of energy cuz you&#39;re using the whole\n430 -> battery and so what did they find well\n432 -> they found that going from 0 to 100%\n435 -> constantly the battery only had about\n438 -> 50% of its capacity after less than a\n441 -> 100 days versus going from 40 to 60%\n445 -> constantly the battery was at about 85%\n448 -> after 400 Days okay well what does this\n451 -> mean as far as context so going from 60\n454 -> to 40% constantly was the equivalent\n457 -> after 400 Days of about 3,200 full\n461 -> cycles of that battery now if you were\n463 -> to have a battery uh on an EV that had a\n466 -> 250 Mi range well that means this\n468 -> battery would last about470 -> 800,000 miles before its degradation\n473 -> reached about 85% so that&#39;s incredible\n477 -> right now the catch is that means you&#39;re\n479 -> only using 20% of the battery so you&#39;d\n481 -> be limiting yourself to 50 m trips\n484 -> personally I don&#39;t stress about this one\n486 -> the easiest way to think of it is to\n488 -> just plug in your car after every trip\n490 -> rather than waiting till the battery is\n491 -> low to recharge it all right so what\n493 -> does Professor Jeff Don recommend he\n496 -> says stick to low stateof charge ranges\n498 -> 25% is great now obviously if you can&#39;t\n501 -> charge at home this is tough to do which\n504 -> is fine if you follow the next rule he\n506 -> says your battery will still very likely\n508 -> outl last the life of the car number\n511 -> three don&#39;t regularly charge to 100%\n515 -> okay what the heck shouldn&#39;t this be the\n517 -> car Maker&#39;s problem not mine yes520 -> absolutely that&#39;s why warranties exist\n523 -> and there are real engineering solutions\n525 -> to these problems so to understand\n527 -> number three let&#39;s look at the\n529 -> engineering Solutions now once again\n531 -> looking at the particles that make up\n532 -> our cathode there&#39;s a very clever\n534 -> solution here we&#39;re instead of using a\n536 -> bunch of many small crystals you use a\n540 -> single crystal structure for the entire\n542 -> particle so what this means is you have\n545 -> uniform expansion and contraction of\n547 -> that entire particle rather than having\n549 -> a bunch of crystallites at different\n551 -> orientations which as they grow and\n553 -> contract they create all these cracks so\n555 -> you avoid that cracking using this\n557 -> single crystal structure this is used in\n560 -> some Modern EVs and it has much longer\n563 -> capacity retention another Trend you&#39;re565 -> tending to see is batteries that are\n567 -> using higher nickel content all right so\n569 -> if you use a battery with more nickel it\n571 -> has better energy density seems like a\n573 -> smart thing to do so what&#39;s the problem\n575 -> well here we&#39;re looking at two different\n577 -> graphs with different nickel content in\n579 -> these batteries this one has about 50%\n582 -> for the cathode this one has about 80%\n584 -> for the cathode so using that higher\n586 -> nickel content you can see the voltage\n588 -> curve looks a bit different where we\n590 -> have this Plateau at the end for that\n592 -> latter portion of the state of charge\n594 -> from about 75% to 100% you&#39;ve got this\n597 -> Plateau well this plateau toe is\n599 -> associated with a large volumetric\n601 -> change so you want to avoid that\n603 -> especially if you&#39;re using these uh you\n605 -> know many small crystallites as the608 -> structure for that cathode so you avoid\n610 -> that region you help avoid that micro\n612 -> cracking well what if you use a single\n615 -> crystal structure and also what if you\n617 -> use a lower nickel content well you\n619 -> don&#39;t have that Plateau you don&#39;t have\n621 -> to worry about that as much no problem\n622 -> you can charge up to 100% the same is\n625 -> basically true for lithium iron\n626 -> phosphate batteries which use a\n628 -> different chemistry all right but even\n630 -> if we&#39;re using a higher nickel content\n632 -> as long as we&#39;re using a single crystal\n634 -> structure we don&#39;t have to worry about\n635 -> cracking right well yes unfortunately\n639 -> this Plateau is also associated with a\n641 -> very small amount of oxygen being\n643 -> released during that portion of charging\n646 -> so you want to avoid this even if you&#39;re\n648 -> using a single crystal structure if you650 -> have a high nickel content battery\n652 -> because that relates to gas formation\n655 -> within the battery which means you&#39;re\n656 -> going to have degradation over time all\n658 -> right what&#39;s what&#39;s the Dr Don\n660 -> recommendation charge to 75% that way\n663 -> you have plenty of range daily and say\n665 -> you have a long trip coming up well\n667 -> charge the night before to 100% to have\n669 -> the extra range if you need it now\n671 -> obviously if you live in an apartment\n673 -> without charging going out and only\n675 -> charging up to 75% sounds very tedious\n678 -> and repetitive and personally I&#39;m of the\n680 -> mindset that if you can&#39;t charge your\n681 -> electric vehicle at home well it really\n683 -> doesn&#39;t make sense for you yet to those\n685 -> who do it hats off to you but it&#39;s\n687 -> certainly not very convenient so I think\n689 -> the simple message is don&#39;t stress about0 -> electric cars have many advantages which\n2 -> have helped lead to their Rising\n3 -> popularity such as requiring a lot less\n6 -> maintenance however the battery is still\n8 -> very expensive and if it ever needs to\n10 -> be replaced it&#39;s a huge expense luckily\n13 -> there are practices you can

grow and\n553 -> contract they create all these cracks so\n555 -> you avoid that cracking using this\n557 -> single crystal structure this is used in\n560 -> some Modern EVs and it has much longer\n563 -> capacity retention another Trend you&#39;re565 -> tending to see is batteries that are\n567 -> using higher nickel content all right so\n569 -> if you use a battery with more nickel it\n571 -> has better energy density seems like a\n573 -> smart thing to do so what&#39;s the problem\n575 -> well here we&#39;re looking at two different\n577 -> graphs with different nickel content in\n579 -> these batteries this one has about 50%\n582 -> for the cathode this one has about 80%\n584 -> for the cathode so using that higher\n586 -> nickel content you can see the voltage\n588 -> curve looks a bit different where we\n590 -> have this Plateau at the end for that\n592 -> latter portion of the state of charge\n594 -> from about 75% to 100% you&#39;ve got this\n597 -> Plateau well this plateau toe is\n599 -> associated with a large volumetric\n601 -> change so you want to avoid that\n603 -> especially if you&#39;re using these uh you\n605 -> know many small crystallites as the608 -> structure for that cathode so you avoid\n610 -> that region you help avoid that micro\n612 -> cracking well what if you use a single\n615 -> crystal structure and also what if you\n617 -> use a lower nickel content well you\n619 -> don&#39;t have that Plateau you don&#39;t have\n621 -> to worry about that as much no problem\n622 -> you can charge up to 100% the same is\n625 -> basically true for lithium iron\n626 -> phosphate batteries which use a\n628 -> different chemistry all right but even\n630 -> if we&#39;re using a higher nickel content\n632 -> as long as we&#39;re using a single crystal\n634 -> structure we don&#39;t have to worry about\n635 -> cracking right well yes unfortunately\n639 -> this Plateau is also associated with a\n641 -> very small amount of oxygen being\n643 -> released during that portion of charging\n646 -> so you want to avoid this even if you&#39;re\n648 -> using a single crystal structure if you650 -> have a high nickel content battery\n652 -> because that relates to gas formation\n655 -> within the battery which means you&#39;re\n656 -> going to have degradation over time all\n658 -> right what&#39;s what&#39;s the Dr Don\n660 -> recommendation charge to 75% that way\n663 -> you have plenty of range daily and say\n665 -> you have a long trip coming up well\n667 -> charge the night before to 100% to have\n669 -> the extra range if you need it now\n671 -> obviously if you live in an apartment\n673 -> without charging going out and only\n675 -> charging up to 75% sounds very tedious\n678 -> and repetitive and personally I&#39;m of the\n680 -> mindset that if you can&#39;t charge your\n681 -> electric vehicle at home well it really\n683 -> doesn&#39;t make sense for you yet to those\n685 -> who do it hats off to you but it&#39;s\n687 -> certainly not very convenient so I think\n689 -> the simple message is don&#39;t stress about0 -> electric cars have many advantages which\n2 -> have helped lead to their Rising\n3 -> popularity such as requiring a lot less\n6 -> maintenance however the battery is still\n8 -> very expensive and if it ever needs to\n10 -> be replaced it&#39;s a huge expense luckily\n13 -> there are practices you can put into\n15 -> place to make the battery last a really\n18 -> really long time and there are things\n20 -> you really shouldn&#39;t do which can\n22 -> dramatically shorten that lifetime my\n24 -> goal for this video is to not only\n25 -> explain the best and worst practices but\n28 -> actually explain why at the microscopic\n31 -> level why these are good or bad ideas\n33 -> now before we get into these practices\n36 -> it&#39;s worth mentioning this video is\n37 -> about nmc batteries meaning batteries\n39 -> made up of nickel manganese and Cobalt\n42 -> oxides it&#39;s a chemistry that gives you a\n44 -> lot of range and it&#39;s commonly used in46 -> the automotive space now if you don&#39;t\n48 -> know what chemistry your electric car&#39;s\n50 -> battery uses and why would you well much\n53 -> of these are good practices regardless\n55 -> we&#39;ll get into exceptions later so we&#39;re\n58 -> going to have three main rules number\n60 -> one don&#39;t store your car&#39;s battery at\n63 -> 100% for long periods of time especially\n66 -> when it&#39;s hot out now leaving your\n68 -> electric car in the hot sun for months\n70 -> at a time sounds like an edge case and\n72 -> it is but it helps lay the foundation\n74 -> for this video now if you haven&#39;t yet\n76 -> seen my video on how a lithium ion\n78 -> battery works that is certainly worth\n80 -> checking out but the big question here\n82 -> is why do batteries lose capacity over\n85 -> time and I&#39;ve Illustrated many of the\n87 -> reasons here there&#39;s a lot of reasons\n89 -> why batteries will lose capacity over91 -> time the important thing to keep in mind\n93 -> is that if the battery is hotter and if\n95 -> the battery is at a higher voltage which\n97 -> occurs when it&#39;s at a higher state of\n99 -> charge these reactions are more\n101 -> prominent and they happen more quickly\n103 -> so you get more degradation when you\n105 -> have higher temperatures and at a higher\n107 -> voltage in other words a higher state of\n109 -> charge so one example I want to look at\n111 -> is called the solid electrolyte\n113 -> interface formation which occurs on both\n116 -> the particles in the anode as well as\n118 -> the particles in the cathode where it is\n120 -> then called cathode electrolyte\n122 -> interface so very simply what happens\n124 -> when you&#39;re originally creating the\n126 -> battery and you add the liquid\n127 -> electrolyte and you put it through its\n129 -> very first charge cycle well this solid\n132 -> electrolyte interface forms on these134 -> particles and this formation consumes\n137 -> the electrolyte it consumes lithium it\n139 -> consumes materials from the cathode and\n141 -> anode and so you&#39;re consuming useful\n143 -> materials from that battery and as a\n145 -> result you actually lose about 10% of\n147 -> the battery&#39;s initial capacity on that\n149 -> very first charge now you as a consumer\n152 -> never see this because this is done at\n153 -> the factory long before you ever get a\n155 -> product using this battery but it is\n157 -> worth mentioning because this continues\n159 -> to grow and so as long as this\n162 -> electrolyte interface continues to grow\n164 -> and consume other materials it means\n165 -> it&#39;s taking away from the usefulness of\n168 -> your battery now there was a really cool\n170 -> study done where they found that if you\n172 -> store a battery at a higher temperature\n174 -> it has more degradation but they also176 -> found that if you store a battery at a\n178 -> higher state of charge it also has more\n180 -> degradation so what did they do well\n182 -> they took a bunch of batteries and they\n184 -> stored them in a room at 50° C so very\n188 -> warm and they stored these batteries\n190 -> with a different state of charge so one\n192 -> of them at 100% state of charge one at\n194 -> 90% one at 80% and so on and what did\n197 -> they find well the battery that was\n199 -> stored at 100% state of charge had less\n202 -> than 60% of its original capacity after\n206 -> less than 200 days so it had degraded a\n210 -> ton versus the battery stored at 30%\n212 -> state of charge was only down to 85% of\n216 -> its original rated capacity after about\n219 -> 400 days so significantly more capacity\n223 -> and much longer duration than it was in\n225 -> the test so heat and voltage are both\n228 -> bad for battery degradation now there&#39;s230 -> an Incredible video by Professor Jeff\n232 -> Dawn a lithium ion battery researcher\n235 -> with seemingly endless knowledge in this\n237 -> space who also had a 5-year research\n239 -> partner partnership with Tesla for\n240 -> battery development he provides specific\n243 -> advice so for each of these three rules\n246 -> I&#39;m going to share his advice for what\n248 -> you should do all right so say you&#39;re\n250 -> storing your electric car for a long\n252 -> period of time and it&#39;s going to be in a\n254 -> hot environment what should you do well\n256 -> he says you should Target a 30% state of\n258 -> charge for that duration now if you&#39;re\n261 -> storing it in the cold even for a long\n263 -> period of time there&#39;s no worries\n265 -> because of the cold temperatures you&#39;ll\n267 -> have very little reactivity so storing\n269 -> it at say 70% is no big deal number two\n272 -> don&#39;t wait until the battery is low to275 -> recharge it unless necessary now the\n277 -> critical part here is that you have a\n279 -> relatively low depth of discharge\n281 -> meaning say keeping your battery at 80%\n284 -> and only discharging to 60% before\n286 -> charging again it&#39;s fine to use the\n289 -> whole battery when you need it but after\n290 -> a short trip plug it in a bunch of small\n293 -> charges is much better than in frequent\n296 -> F depth charges okay so why well let&#39;s\n300 -> look at the particles that make up the\n301 -> cathode and if we zoom in on one of\n304 -> these electrode particles we can see\n306 -> that it&#39;s made up of many many many\n309 -> small crystallites and each one of these\n311 -> small crystallites has its own structure\n313 -> that&#39;s repeated so you&#39;ve got oxygen\n315 -> metals and lithium that&#39;s moving to and\n317 -> from the anode back to the cathode back\n319 -> to the anode and so as this lithium322 -> leaves this crystal structure well this\n324 -> formation expands in One Direction and\n327 -> it shrinks in another formation and\n330 -> again the orientation of these are all\n332 -> over the place so you&#39;ve got a bunch of\n334 -> different crystals all with different\n335 -> orientation that are expanding and\n337 -> Contracting in different ways so you can\n340 -> imagine that as that keeps happening you\n342 -> start to have cracks form within this\n344 -> particle as these particles are getting\n346 -> bigger and smaller they&#39;re creating\n347 -> these cracks within the particle well as\n350 -> these cracks form you have that cathode\n353 -> electrolyte interface formation so again\n355 -> you start consuming more materials more\n358 -> useful materials within the battery from\n360 -> the electrolyte the lithium things like\n363 -> that and so you have battery degradation\n365 -> okay so why does depth of discharge367 -> matter then well the growth of these\n370 -> crystals is roughly proportional to the\n373 -> depth of discharge so for example if\n375 -> you&#39;re just going from 60% battery to\n377 -> 40% battery well that&#39;s only 20% of your\n380 -> total battery right versus if you&#39;re\n382 -> going from 100% to 0% 100% of your total\n385 -> battery so that 60 to 40 has about a\n387 -> fifth of the effect of this growth and\n390 -> contraction that you have Within These\n392 -> crystals meaning if you use these\n394 -> smaller battery ranges you have much\n397 -> less cracking occur within these\n398 -> particles and the battery lasts\n400 -> significantly longer so again a really\n403 -> cool study looked at how a battery&#39;s\n405 -> depth of discharge impacted its\n407 -> normalized capacity over time okay so\n409 -> for this study they&#39;re putting the same\n411 -> amount of energy in and out of all the\n414 -> batteries but they&#39;re using a different416 -> percentage of the battery to do it so\n418 -> for example if you&#39;re just going from\n420 -> 40% to 60% well you&#39;re going to have a\n422 -> bunch of small charges versus if you&#39;re\n424 -> going from 0 to 100% you&#39;re going to\n426 -> have fewer charges but the same amount\n428 -> of energy cuz you&#39;re using the whole\n430 -> battery and so what did they find well\n432 -> they found that going from 0 to 100%\n435 -> constantly the battery only had about\n438 -> 50% of its capacity after less than a\n441 -> 100 days versus going from 40 to 60%\n445 -> constantly the battery was at about 85%\n448 -> after 400 Days okay well what does this\n451 -> mean as far as context so going from 60\n454 -> to 40% constantly was the equivalent\n457 -> after 400 Days of about 3,200 full\n461 -> cycles of that battery now if you were\n463 -> to have a battery uh on an EV that had a\n466 -> 250 Mi range well that means this\n468 -> battery would last about470 -> 800,000 miles before its degradation\n473 -> reached about 85% so that&#39;s incredible\n477 -> right now the catch is that means you&#39;re\n479 -> only using 20% of the battery so you&#39;d\n481 -> be limiting yourself to 50 m trips\n484 -> personally I don&#39;t stress about this one\n486 -> the easiest way to think of it is to\n488 -> just plug in your car after every trip\n490 -> rather than waiting till the battery is\n491 -> low to recharge it all right so what\n493 -> does Professor Jeff Don recommend he\n496 -> says stick to low stateof charge ranges\n498 -> 25% is great now obviously if you can&#39;t\n501 -> charge at home this is tough to do which\n504 -> is fine if you follow the next rule he\n506 -> says your battery will still very likely\n508 -> outl last the life of the car number\n511 -> three don&#39;t regularly charge to 100%\n515 -> okay what the heck shouldn&#39;t this be the\n517 -> car Maker&#39;s problem not mine yes520 -> absolutely that&#39;s why warranties exist\n523 -> and there are real engineering solutions\n525 -> to these problems so to understand\n527 -> number three let&#39;s look at the\n529 -> engineering Solutions now once again\n531 -> looking at the particles that make up\n532 -> our cathode there&#39;s a very clever\n534 -> solution here we&#39;re instead of using a\n536 -> bunch of many small crystals you use a\n540

higher\n586 -> nickel content you can see the voltage\n588 -> curve looks a bit different where we\n590 -> have this Plateau at the end for that\n592 -> latter portion of the state of charge\n594 -> from about 75% to 100% you&#39;ve got this\n597 -> Plateau well this plateau toe is\n599 -> associated with a large volumetric\n601 -> change so you want to avoid that\n603 -> especially if you&#39;re using these uh you\n605 -> know many small crystallites as the608 -> structure for that cathode so you avoid\n610 -> that region you help avoid that micro\n612 -> cracking well what if you use a

problem\n622 -> you can charge up to 100% the same is\n625 -> basically true for lithium iron\n626 -> phosphate batteries which use a\n628 -> different chemistry all right but even\n630 -> if

things like\n363 -> that and so you have battery degradation\n365 -> okay so why does depth of discharge367 -> matter then well the growth of these\n370 -> crystals is roughly proportional to the\n373 -> depth of discharge so for example if\n375 -> you&#39;re just going from 60% battery to\n377 -> 40% battery well that&#39;s only 20% of your\n380 -> total battery right versus if you&#39;re\n382 -> going from 100% to 0% 100% of your total\n385 -> battery so that 60 to 40 has about a\n387 -> fifth of the effect of this growth and\n390 -> contraction that you have Within These\n392 -> crystals meaning if you use these\n394 -> smaller battery ranges you have much\n397 -> less cracking occur within these\n398 -> particles and the battery lasts\n400 -> significantly longer so again a really\n403 -> cool study looked at how a battery&#39;s\n405 -> depth of discharge impacted its\n407 -> normalized capacity over time okay so\n409 -> for this study they&#39;re putting the same\n411 -> amount of energy in and out of all the\n414 -> batteries but they&#39;re using a different416 -> percentage of the battery to do it so\n418 -> for example if you&#39;re just going from\n420 -> 40% to 60% well you&#39;re going to have a\n422 -> bunch of small charges versus if you&#39;re\n424 -> going from 0 to 100% you&#39;re going to\n426 -> have fewer charges but the same amount\n428 -> of energy cuz you&#39;re using the whole\n430 -> battery and so what did they find well\n432 -> they found that going from 0 to 100%\n435 -> constantly the battery only had about\n438 -> 50% of its capacity after less than a\n441 -> 100 days versus going from 40 to 60%\n445 -> constantly the battery was at about 85%\n448 -> after 400 Days okay well what does this\n451 -> mean as far as context so going from 60\n454 -> to 40% constantly was the equivalent\n457 -> after 400 Days of about 3,200 full\n461 -> cycles of that battery now if you were\n463 -> to have a battery uh on an EV that had a\n466 -> 250 Mi range well that means this\n468 -> battery would last about470 -> 800,000 miles before its degradation\n473 -> reached about 85% so that&#39;s incredible\n477 -> right now the catch is that means you&#39;re\n479 -> only using 20% of the battery so you&#39;d\n481 -> be limiting yourself to 50 m trips\n484 -> personally I don&#39;t stress about this one\n486 -> the easiest way to think of it is to\n488 -> just plug in your car after every trip\n490 -> rather than waiting till the battery is\n491 -> low to recharge it all right so what\n493 -> does Professor Jeff Don recommend he\n496 -> says stick to low stateof charge ranges\n498 -> 25% is great now obviously if you can&#39;t\n501 -> charge at home this is tough to do which\n504 -> is fine if you follow the next rule he\n506 -> says your battery will still very likely\n508 -> outl last the life of the car number\n511 -> three don&#39;t regularly charge to 100%\n515 -> okay what the heck shouldn&#39;t this be the\n517 -> car Maker&#39;s problem not mine yes520 -> absolutely that&#39;s why warranties exist\n523 -> and there are real engineering solutions\n525 -> to these problems so to understand\n527 -> number three let&#39;s look at the\n529 -> engineering Solutions now once again\n531 -> looking at the particles that make up\n532 -> our cathode there&#39;s a very clever\n534 -> solution here we&#39;re instead of using a\n536 -> bunch of many small crystals you use a\n540 -> single crystal structure for the entire\n542 -> particle so what this means is you have\n545 -> uniform expansion and contraction of\n547 -> that entire particle rather than having\n549 -> a bunch of crystallites at different\n551 -> orientations which as they grow and\n553 -> contract they create all these cracks so\n555 -> you avoid that cracking using this\n557 -> single crystal structure this is used in\n560 -> some Modern EVs and it has much longer\n563 -> capacity retention another Trend you&#39;re565 -> tending to see is batteries that are\n567 -> using higher nickel content all right so\n569 -> if you use a battery with more nickel it\n571 -> has better energy density seems like a\n573 -> smart thing to do so what&#39;s the problem\n575 -> well here we&#39;re looking at two different\n577 -> graphs with different nickel content in\n579 -> these batteries this one has about 50%\n582 -> for the cathode this one has about 80%\n584 -> for the cathode so using that higher\n586 -> nickel content you can see the voltage\n588 -> curve looks a bit different where we\n590 -> have this Plateau at the end for that\n592 -> latter portion of the state of charge\n594 -> from about 75% to 100% you&#39;ve got this\n597 -> Plateau well this plateau toe is\n599 -> associated with a large volumetric\n601 -> change so you want to avoid that\n603 -> especially if you&#39;re using these uh you\n605 -> know many small crystallites as the608 -> structure for that cathode so you avoid\n610 -> that region you help avoid that micro\n612 -> cracking well what if you use a single\n615 -> crystal structure and also what if you\n617 -> use a lower nickel content well you\n619 -> don&#39;t have that Plateau you don&#39;t have\n621 -> to worry about that as much no problem\n622 -> you can charge up to 100% the same is\n625 -> basically true for lithium iron\n626 -> phosphate batteries which use a\n628 -> different chemistry all right but even\n630 -> if we&#39;re using a higher nickel content\n632 -> as long as we&#39;re using a single crystal\n634 -> structure we don&#39;t have to worry about\n635 -> cracking right well yes unfortunately\n639 -> this Plateau is also associated with a\n641 -> very small amount of oxygen being\n643 -> released during that portion of charging\n646 -> so you want to avoid this even if you&#39;re\n648 -> using a single crystal structure if you650 -> have a high nickel content battery\n652 -> because that relates to gas formation\n655 -> within the battery which means you&#39;re\n656 -> going to have degradation over time all\n658 -> right what&#39;s what&#39;s the Dr Don\n660 -> recommendation charge to 75% that way\n663 -> you have plenty of range daily and say\n665 -> you have a long trip coming up well\n667 -> charge the night before to 100% to have\n669 -> the extra range if you need it now\n671 -> obviously if you live in an apartment\n673 -> without charging going out and only\n675 -> charging up to 75% sounds very tedious\n678 -> and repetitive and personally I&#39;m of the\n680 -> mindset that if you can&#39;t charge your\n681 -> electric vehicle at home well it really\n683 -> doesn&#39;t make sense for you yet to those\n685 -> who do it hats off to you but it&#39;s\n687 -> certainly not very convenient so I think\n689 -> the simple message is don&#39;t stress about0 -> electric cars have many advantages which\n2 -> have helped lead to their Rising\n3 -> popularity such as requiring a lot less\n6 -> maintenance however the battery is still\n8 -> very expensive and if it ever needs to\n10 -> be replaced it&#39;s a huge expense luckily\n13 -> there are practices you can put into\n15 -> place to make the battery last a really\n18 -> really long time and there are things\n20 -> you really shouldn&#39;t do which can\n22 -> dramatically shorten that lifetime my\n24 -> goal for this video is to not only\n25 -> explain the best and worst practices but\n28 -> actually explain why at the microscopic\n31 -> level why these are good or bad ideas\n33 -> now before we get into these practices\n36 -> it&#39;s worth mentioning this video is\n37 -> about nmc batteries meaning batteries\n39 -> made up of nickel manganese and Cobalt\n42 -> oxides it&#39;s a chemistry that gives you a\n44 -> lot of range and it&#39;s commonly used in46 -> the automotive space now if you don&#39;t\n48 -> know what chemistry your electric car&#39;s\n50 -> battery uses and why would you well much\n53 -> of these are good practices regardless\n55 -> we&#39;ll get into exceptions later so we&#39;re\n58 -> going to have three main rules number\n60 -> one don&#39;t store your car&#39;s battery at\n63 -> 100% for long periods of time especially\n66 -> when it&#39;s hot out now leaving your\n68 -> electric car in the hot sun for months\n70 -> at a time sounds like an edge case and\n72 -> it is but it helps lay the foundation\n74 -> for this video now if you haven&#39;t yet\n76 -> seen my video on how a lithium ion\n78 -> battery works that is certainly worth\n80 -> checking out but the big question here\n82 -> is why do batteries lose capacity over\n85 -> time and I&#39;ve Illustrated many of the\n87 -> reasons here there&#39;s a lot of reasons\n89 -> why batteries will lose capacity over91 -> time the important thing to keep in mind\n93 -> is that if the battery is hotter and if\n95 -> the battery is at a higher voltage which\n97 -> occurs when it&#39;s at a higher state of\n99 -> charge these reactions are more\n101 -> prominent and they happen more quickly\n103 -> so you get more degradation when you\n105 -> have higher temperatures and at a higher\n107 -> voltage in other words a higher state of\n109 -> charge so one example I want to look at\n111 -> is called the solid electrolyte\n113 -> interface formation which occurs on both\n116 -> the particles in the anode as well as\n118 -> the particles in the cathode where it is\n120 -> then called cathode electrolyte\n122 -> interface so very simply what happens\n124 -> when you&#39;re originally creating the\n126 -> battery and you add the liquid\n127 -> electrolyte and you put it through its\n129 -> very first charge cycle well this solid\n132 -> electrolyte interface forms on these134 -> particles and this formation consumes\n137 -> the electrolyte it consumes lithium it\n139 -> consumes materials from the cathode and\n141 -> anode and so you&#39;re consuming useful\n143 -> materials from that battery and as a\n145 -> result you actually lose about 10% of\n147 -> the battery&#39;s initial capacity on that\n149 -> very first charge now you as a consumer\n152 -> never see this because this is done at\n153 -> the factory long before you ever get a\n155 -> product using this battery but it is\n157 -> worth mentioning because this continues\n159 -> to grow and so as long as this\n162 -> electrolyte interface continues to grow\n164 -> and consume other materials it means\n165 -> it&#39;s taking away from the usefulness of\n168 -> your battery now there was a really cool\n170 -> study done where they found that if you\n172 -> store a battery at a higher temperature\n174 -> it has more degradation but they also176 -> found that if you store a battery at a\n178 -> higher state of charge it also has more\n180 -> degradation so what did they do well\n182 -> they took a bunch of batteries and they\n184 -> stored them in a room at 50° C so very\n188 -> warm and they stored these batteries\n190 -> with a different state of charge so one\n192 -> of them at 100% state of charge one at\n194 -> 90% one at 80% and so on and what did\n197 -> they find well the battery that was\n199 -> stored at 100% state of charge had less\n202 -> than 60% of its original capacity after\n206 -> less than 200 days so it had degraded a\n210 -> ton versus the battery stored at 30%\n212 -> state of charge was only down to 85% of\n216 -> its original rated capacity after about\n219 -> 400 days so significantly more capacity\n223 -> and much longer duration than it was in\n225 -> the test so heat and voltage are both\n228 -> bad for battery degradation now there&#39;s230 -> an Incredible video by Professor Jeff\n232 -> Dawn a lithium ion battery researcher\n235 -> with seemingly endless knowledge in this\n237 -> space who also had a 5-year research\n239 -> partner partnership with Tesla for\n240 -> battery development he provides specific\n243 -> advice so for each of these three rules\n246 -> I&#39;m going to share his advice for what\n248 -> you should do all right so say you&#39;re\n250 -> storing your electric car for a long\n252 -> period of time and it&#39;s going to be in a\n254 -> hot environment what should you do well\n256 -> he says you should Target a 30% state of\n258 -> charge for that duration now if you&#39;re\n261 -> storing it in the cold even for a long\n263 -> period of time there&#39;s no worries\n265 -> because of the cold temperatures you&#39;ll\n267 -> have very little reactivity so storing\n269 -> it at say 70% is no big deal number two\n272 -> don&#39;t wait until the battery is low to275 -> recharge it unless necessary now the\n277 -> critical part here is that you have a\n279 -> relatively low depth of discharge\n281 -> meaning say keeping your battery at 80%\n284 -> and only discharging to 60% before\n286 -> charging again it&#39;s fine to use the\n289 -> whole battery when you need it but after\n290 -> a short trip plug it in a bunch of small\n293 -> charges is much better than in frequent\n296 -> F depth charges okay so why well let&#39;s\n300 -> look at the particles that make up the\n301 -> cathode and if we zoom in on one of\n304 -> these electrode particles we can see\n306 -> that it&#39;s made up of many many many\n309 -> small crystallites and each one of these\n311 -> small crystallites has its own structure\n313 -> that&#39;s repeated so you&#39;ve got oxygen\n315 -> metals and lithium that&#39;s moving to and\n317 -> from the anode back to the cathode back\n319 -> to the anode and so as this lithium322 -> leaves this crystal structure well this\n324 -> formation expands in One Direction and\n327 -> it shrinks in another formation and\n330 -> again the orientation of these are all\n332 -> over the place so you&#39;ve got a bunch of\n334 -> different crystals all with different\n335 -> orientation that are expanding and\n337 -> Contracting in different ways so you can\n340 -> imagine that as that keeps happening you\n342 -> start to have cracks form within this\n344 -> particle as these particles are getting\n346 -> bigger and smaller they&#39;re creating\n347 -> these cracks within the particle well as\n350 -> these cracks form you have that cathode\n353 -> electrolyte interface formation so again\n355 -> you start consuming more materials more\n358 -> useful materials within the battery from\n360 -> the electrolyte the lithium things like\n363 -> that and so you have battery degradation\n365 -> okay so why does depth of discharge367 -> matter then well the growth of these\n370 -> crystals is roughly proportional to the\n373 -> depth of discharge so for example if\n375 -> you&#39;re just going from 60% battery to\n377 -> 40% battery well that&#39;s only 20% of your\n380 -> total battery right versus if you&#39;re\n382 -> going from 100% to 0% 100% of your total\n385 -> battery so that 60 to 40 has about a\n387 -> fifth of the effect of this growth and\n390 -> contraction that you have Within These\n392 -> crystals meaning if you use these\n394 -> smaller battery ranges you have much\n397 -> less cracking occur within these\n398 -> particles and the battery lasts\n400 -> significantly longer so again a really\n403 -> cool study looked at how a battery&#39;s\n405 -> depth of discharge impacted its\n407 -> normalized capacity over time okay so\n409 -> for this study they&#39;re putting the same\n411 -> amount of energy in and out of all the\n414 -> batteries but they&#39;re using a different416 -> percentage of the battery to do it so\n418 -> for example if you&#39;re just going from\n420 -> 40% to 60% well you&#39;re going to have a\n422 -> bunch of small charges versus if you&#39;re\n424 -> going from 0 to 100% you&#39;re going to\n426 -> have fewer charges but the same amount\n428 -> of energy cuz you&#39;re using the whole\n430 -> battery and so what did they find well\n432 -> they found that going from 0 to 100%\n435 -> constantly the battery only had about\n438 -> 50% of its capacity after less than a\n441 -> 100 days versus going from 40 to 60%\n445 -> constantly the battery was at about 85%\n448 -> after 400 Days okay well what does this\n451 -> mean as far as context so going from 60\n454 -> to 40% constantly was the equivalent\n457 -> after 400 Days of about 3,200 full\n461 -> cycles of that battery now if you were\n463 -> to have a battery uh on an EV that had a\n466 -> 250 Mi range well that means this\n468 -> battery would last about470 -> 800,000 miles before its degradation\n473 -> reached about 85% so that&#39;s incredible\n477 -> right now the catch is that means you&#39;re\n479 -> only using 20% of the battery so you&#39;d\n481 -> be limiting yourself to 50 m trips\n484 -> personally I

what did\n197 -> they find well the battery that was\n199 -> stored at 100% state of charge had less\n202 -> than 60% of its original capacity after\n206 -> less than 200 days so it had degraded a\n210 -> ton versus the battery stored at 30%\n212 -> state of charge was only down to 85% of\n216 -> its original rated capacity after about\n219 -> 400 days so significantly more capacity\n223 -> and much longer duration than it was in\n225 -> the test so heat and voltage are both\n228 -> bad for battery degradation now there&#39;s230 -> an Incredible video by Professor Jeff\n232 -> Dawn a lithium ion battery researcher\n235 -> with seemingly endless knowledge in this\n237 -> space who also had a 5-year research\n239 -> partner partnership with Tesla for\n240 -> battery development he provides specific\n243 -> advice so for each of these three rules\n246 -> I&#39;m going to share his advice for what\n248 -> you should do all right so say you&#39;re\n250 -> storing your electric car for a long\n252 -> period of time and it&#39;s going to be in a\n254 -> hot environment what should you do well\n256 -> he says you should Target a 30% state of\n258 -> charge for that duration now if you&#39;re\n261 -> storing it in the cold even for a long\n263 -> period of time there&#39;s no worries\n265 -> because of the cold temperatures you&#39;ll\n267 -> have very little reactivity so storing\n269 -> it at say 70% is no big deal number two\n272 -> don&#39;t wait until the battery is low to275 -> recharge it unless necessary now the\n277 -> critical part here is that you have a\n279 -> relatively low depth of discharge\n281 -> meaning say keeping your battery at 80%\n284 -> and only discharging to 60% before\n286 -> charging again it&#39;s fine to use the\n289 -> whole battery when you need it but after\n290 -> a short trip plug it in a bunch of small\n293 -> charges is much better than in frequent\n296 -> F depth charges okay so why well let&#39;s\n300 -> look at the particles that make up the\n301 -> cathode and if we zoom in on one of\n304 -> these electrode particles we can see\n306 -> that it&#39;s made up of many many many\n309 -> small crystallites and each one of these\n311 -> small crystallites has its own structure\n313 -> that&#39;s repeated so you&#39;ve got oxygen\n315 -> metals and lithium that&#39;s moving to and\n317 -> from the anode back to the cathode back\n319 -> to the anode and so as this lithium322 -> leaves this crystal structure well this\n324 -> formation expands in One Direction and\n327 -> it shrinks in another formation and\n330 -> again the orientation of these are all\n332 -> over the place so you&#39;ve got a bunch of\n334 -> different crystals all with different\n335 -> orientation that are expanding and\n337 -> Contracting in different ways so you can\n340 -> imagine that as that keeps happening you\n342 -> start to have cracks form within this\n344 -> particle as these particles are getting\n346 -> bigger and smaller they&#39;re creating\n347 -> these cracks within the particle well as\n350 -> these cracks form you have that cathode\n353 -> electrolyte interface formation so again\n355 -> you start consuming more materials more\n358 -> useful materials within the battery from\n360 -> the electrolyte the lithium things like\n363 -> that and so you have battery degradation\n365 -> okay so why does depth of discharge367 -> matter then well the growth of these\n370 -> crystals is roughly proportional to the\n373 -> depth of discharge so for example if\n375 -> you&#39;re just going from 60% battery to\n377 -> 40% battery well that&#39;s only 20% of your\n380 -> total battery right versus if you&#39;re\n382 -> going from 100% to 0% 100% of your total\n385 -> battery so that 60 to 40 has about a\n387 -> fifth of the effect of this growth and\n390 -> contraction that you have Within These\n392 -> crystals meaning if you use these\n394 -> smaller battery ranges you have much\n397 -> less cracking occur within these\n398 -> particles and the battery lasts\n400 -> significantly longer so again a really\n403 -> cool study looked at how a battery&#39;s\n405 -> depth of discharge impacted its\n407 -> normalized capacity over time okay so\n409 -> for this study they&#39;re putting the same\n411 -> amount of energy in and out of all the\n414 -> batteries but they&#39;re using a different416 -> percentage of the battery to do it so\n418 -> for example if you&#39;re just going from\n420 -> 40% to 60% well you&#39;re going to have a\n422 -> bunch of small charges versus if you&#39;re\n424 -> going from 0 to 100% you&#39;re going to\n426 -> have fewer charges but the same amount\n428 -> of energy cuz you&#39;re using the whole\n430 -> battery and so what did they find well\n432 -> they found that going from 0 to 100%\n435 -> constantly the battery only had about\n438 -> 50% of its capacity after less than a\n441 -> 100 days versus going from 40 to 60%\n445 -> constantly the battery was at about 85%\n448 -> after 400 Days okay well what does this\n451 -> mean as far as context so going from 60\n454 -> to 40% constantly was the equivalent\n457 -> after 400 Days of about 3,200 full\n461 -> cycles of that battery now if you were\n463 -> to have a battery uh on an EV that had a\n466 -> 250 Mi range well that means this\n468 -> battery would last about470 -> 800,000 miles before its degradation\n473 -> reached about 85% so that&#39;s incredible\n477 -> right now the catch is that means you&#39;re\n479 -> only using 20% of the battery so you&#39;d\n481 -> be limiting yourself to 50 m trips\n484 -> personally I don&#39;t stress about this one\n486 -> the easiest way to think of it is to\n488 -> just plug in your car after every trip\n490 -> rather than waiting till the battery is\n491 -> low to recharge it all right so what\n493 -> does Professor Jeff Don recommend he\n496 -> says stick to low stateof charge ranges\n498 -> 25% is great now obviously if you can&#39;t\n501 -> charge at home this is tough to do which\n504 -> is fine if you follow the next rule he\n506 -> says your battery will still very likely\n508 -> outl last the life of the car number\n511 -> three don&#39;t regularly charge to 100%\n515 -> okay what the heck shouldn&#39;t this be the\n517 -> car Maker&#39;s problem not mine yes520 -> absolutely that&#39;s why warranties exist\n523 -> and there are real engineering solutions\n525 -> to these problems so to understand\n527 -> number three let&#39;s look at the\n529 -> engineering Solutions now once again\n531 -> looking at the particles that make up\n532 -> our cathode there&#39;s a very clever\n534 -> solution here we&#39;re instead of using a\n536 -> bunch of many small crystals you use a\n540 -> single crystal structure for the entire\n542 -> particle so what this means is you have\n545 -> uniform expansion and contraction of\n547 -> that entire particle rather than having\n549 -> a bunch of crystallites at different\n551 -> orientations which as they grow and\n553 -> contract they create all these cracks so\n555 -> you avoid that cracking using this\n557 -> single crystal structure this is used in\n560 -> some Modern EVs and it has much longer\n563 -> capacity retention another Trend you&#39;re565 -> tending to see is batteries that are\n567 -> using higher nickel content all right so\n569 -> if you use a battery with more nickel it\n571 -> has better energy density seems like a\n573 -> smart thing to do so what&#39;s the problem\n575 -> well here we&#39;re looking at two different\n577 -> graphs with different nickel content in\n579 -> these batteries this one has about 50%\n582 -> for the cathode this one has about 80%\n584 -> for the cathode so using that higher\n586 -> nickel content you can see the voltage\n588 -> curve looks a bit different where we\n590 -> have this Plateau at the end for that\n592 -> latter portion of the state of charge\n594 -> from about 75% to 100% you&#39;ve got this\n597 -> Plateau well this plateau toe is\n599 -> associated with a large volumetric\n601 -> change so you want to avoid that\n603 -> especially if you&#39;re using these uh you\n605 -> know many small crystallites as the608 -> structure for that cathode so you avoid\n610 -> that region you help avoid that micro\n612 -> cracking well what if you use a single\n615 -> crystal structure and also what if you\n617 -> use a lower nickel content well you\n619 -> don&#39;t have that Plateau you don&#39;t have\n621 -> to worry about that as much no problem\n622 -> you can charge up to 100% the same is\n625 -> basically true for lithium iron\n626 -> phosphate batteries which use a\n628 -> different chemistry all right but even\n630 -> if we&#39;re using a higher nickel content\n632 -> as long as we&#39;re using a single crystal\n634 -> structure we don&#39;t have to worry about\n635 -> cracking right well yes unfortunately\n639 -> this Plateau is also associated with a\n641 -> very small amount of oxygen being\n643 -> released during that portion of charging\n646 -> so you want to avoid this even if you&#39;re\n648 -> using a single crystal structure if you650 -> have a high nickel content battery\n652 -> because that relates to gas formation\n655 -> within the battery which means you&#39;re\n656 -> going to have degradation over time all\n658 -> right what&#39;s what&#39;s the Dr Don\n660 -> recommendation charge to 75% that way\n663 -> you have plenty of range daily and say\n665 -> you have a long trip coming up well\n667 -> charge the night before to 100% to have\n669 -> the extra range if you need it now\n671 -> obviously if you live in an apartment\n673 -> without charging going out and only\n675 -> charging up to 75% sounds very tedious\n678 -> and repetitive and personally I&#39;m of the\n680 -> mindset that if you can&#39;t charge your\n681 -> electric vehicle at home well it really\n683 -> doesn&#39;t make sense for you yet to those\n685 -> who do it hats off to you but it&#39;s\n687 -> certainly not very convenient so I think\n689 -> the simple message is don&#39;t stress about
